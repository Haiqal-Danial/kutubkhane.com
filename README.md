## About
A personal website where I develop _anything_ I wish. Functions as my portfolio, a platform where I can freely share my thoughts & ideas, and who knows a small online shop?

## Plans

### Short-term (< 2 years)
- Create a UI based on typewriter theme
- Background to change to a rough paper feel
- Redesign logo? (Nah, I want to stick with the intricate design)
- Create pages:
  - Home
  - About me
  - A Drop of Knowledge
  - Support me
  - Linkedin page / social media pages
  - Projects (draft)
### Long-term (> 2 years)
