## About
A personal website where I develop _anything_ I wish. Functions as my portfolio, a platform where I can freely share my thoughts & ideas, and who knows a small online shop?
\
\
I chose to develop as I learn so that I can see the progress of my knowledge in web development from start to mastery. There will be a lot of issues in the start but I hope it will be fixed as time goes on. This is my first project and I wanted it to be a personal one so the best solution is "why not make my own website?".
